      <itunes:summary>At the end of episode three, Ulysses S. Grant decided to run as the Republican nominee for president in the 1868 election. Coming up in episode four, Grant is inaugurated.




But there is some important history in between. This week, we’re going to fill in those gaps with an episode from another podcast. Hosted by executive producer Lindsay Graham, American Elections: Wicked Game is an in-depth look at all 59 U.S. presidential elections.




In 1868, while Andrew Johnson went on an early and norm-breaking campaign tour to promote his reelection, he was not ultimately chosen to lead the Democratic ticket. Instead, it was Horatio Seymour of New York that went head-to-head with Grant.




But the battle lines were the same: was the country to remain a “white man’s government,” as Seymour promised it would, or could Grant take back the reins of Reconstruction, and lead a broken nation to healing through equity?




Please enjoy Episode 21 from the podcast American Elections: Wicked Game: 1868, Seymour vs Grant: The Rise of the General.




1865 returns with episode four next week.

      <itunes:summary>Last week, 1865 writers and co-creators Steve Walters and Erik Archilla spoke with the hosts of the podcast Totalus Rankium--an irreverent and often cheeky revue of American presidents from a Brittish perspective. These two gents, Rob and Jamie, rank each president in categories of statesmanship, scandal, how Hollywood-ready they are, and how good their official portrait is.

The podcast aired over the weekend, but Rob and Jaimie were kind enough to allow me to rebroadcast the episode on our feed. I hope you enjoy it, and if you do, be sure to subscribe to Totalus Rankium--they’ve just finished their ranking of Rutherford B Hayes, who of course succeeded Ulysses S Grant, who of course succeeded Andrew Johnson.

It’s a great show, amusing but informative, much like their conversation with Steve and Erik.
